KBC-style Homepage UI

Files added:
- index.html
- styles.css

Notes:
- Place the provided assets in the same folder:
  - `kbcbg.png` (background)
  - `llramanujan.png` (center main circular logo)
  - `logo 1.jpeg` (left school logo)
  - `sr.png` (right portrait)

How to preview:
- Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or via a local server).

Design highlights:
- Full-screen dark-blue game-show background.
- Circular logos (cropped via CSS) with entrance and pulse animations.
- Bottom-centre yellow PLAY button with neon glow, pulse, and hover shine.
- Responsive (desktop-first) layout; left/right logos hide on small screens.

If you want, I can:
- Move images to an `assets/` folder and update paths.
- Add a small JS file for button interactions (sound/transition).
